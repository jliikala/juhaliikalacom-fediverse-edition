# These are just examples, use your own post slugs and image paths to apply cover photos to posts.
# For example, let's say you have a post at this URL: myblog.com/2024/08/25/my-amazing-post.html
# The slug for that post would be my-amazing-post (without the .html part)
# for the image part, you can use any URL that has an image you'd like to use,
# whether it's some local image on your site or perhaps some image from unsplash.com
# don't forget image attribution if you're using Unsplash images :)
